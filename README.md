# A roguelike dungeon crawler
 A roguelike dungeon crawler made in C++ (with ASCII graphics).
 
 Inspired by Rogue and other ASCII based games. 

4/14/2021: The game is currently being rewritten to include more efficient ways to program like header files.

4/15/2021: New rewritten code displays properly.

FAQ (that no one has asked yet):
Q: Will the game have any releases on Mac/OSX
A: No. I am currently using a library that can only be used on Windows machines, but Mac support could come far in the future.

Q: Is this game good?
A: Probably not, and you might not even like the idea. I like ASCII style games and it's my first 'actual' game, so it will probably not be very good, but I will try my best. :)

Q: How will this game play?
A: This game will control pretty similar to Rogue (1980) as far as movement goes, but the controls with other parts of the game are still TBD.

Q: Why is the download named game.exe? That's quite sketchy...
A: It is quite sketchy, but I haven't figured out a better way to do this yet, so for now it'll have to be sketchy.

(To clear things up: The game is compiled using GCC and the .exe file in the release is the compiled application)
